# QuPath FX

## What's here?

This repository contains several Java modules that can help when working with JavaFX.

The code is developed alongside [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io), but is intended to be useful for other projects too.

With this in mind, *these modules don't depend on QuPath* and can be used independently.
